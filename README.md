## Learn Xamarin and create Android and iOS apps that share C# code
With Xamarin you can use C# to create Android and iOS apps. Plus, that C# codebase will be 100% shared between projects, and compile to native code, so performance is not impacted.

| Share C# Code | Create the UI with XAML |
| ------------- |:-------------:|

| Code your whole logic once, share it between the Android and iOS native projects.       | Xamarin translates your XAML code into native UI elements, so your apps feel native -because they are.      |

| Learn to define the user interface using XAML, handle user interactions using C#, use a local database to store and retrieve data, and list all the information.      | Get the device's location and use it to get a list of nearby venues using the Foursquare REST API and HTTP requests. Then update the SQLite table with that info.      |   Clean your code by implementing the MVVM architectural pattern and feel like an expert using Binding, Commands and Observable Collections. |

## Day by Day

Curious about what you will learn? Here is the list of topics that we cover day by day:
1. **XAML and Events.** Defining the interface and handling user interactions.
2. **Using XAML Styles.** Reusing XAML code with Style Resources.
3. **Creating an SQLite Database.** Prepare the projects to use SQLite and get the file's path.
4. **Inserting to the Database.** Model the database table, create a connection and start adding elements to the table.
5. **Reading and Listing a Table.** Read the database table and list the retrieved elements in a ListView.
6. **Getting the User's Location.** Get the user's permission to access location, then get the coordinates.
7. **Making REST Requests.** Make HTTP requests to Foursquare's REST API to get nearby venues.
8. **The INotifyPropertyChanged interface.** Implement the interface to notify the view of property changes.
9. **Defining and Binding Commands.** Substitute event handlers with Commands.
10. **Using Observable Collections.** Notify the view of collection changes with the ObservableCollection<T> class.
